        There’s a ton of incredibly promising intermittent fasting (IF) research
        done on fat rats. They lose weight, their blood pressure, cholesterol,
        and blood sugars improve… but they’re rats. Studies in humans, almost
        across the board, have shown that IF is safe and incredibly effective,
        but really no more effective than any other diet. In addition, many
        people find it difficult to fast. But a growing body of research
        suggests that the timing of the fast is key, and can make IF a more
        realistic, sustainable, and effective approach for weight loss, as well
        as for diabetes prevention.
